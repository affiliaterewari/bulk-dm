// Import the dotenv library
require('dotenv').config();

// Access the environment variables
const instagramUsername = process.env.INSTAGRAM_USERNAME;
const instagramPassword = process.env.INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD;
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
const secretKey = process.env.SECRET_KEY;

// Use the environment variables in your application logic
// ...




In this example, the `require('dotenv').config()` line loads the environment variables from the ".env" file into the application environment. The `process.env` object is then used to access the values of the environment variables.

Remember to test the application thoroughly to verify that it can securely access and utilize the environment variables. Also, provide comments and documentation within the ".env" file to explain the purpose and usage of each environment variable.
